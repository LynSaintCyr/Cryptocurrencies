# Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies analysis with unsupervised machine learning

# Background

The point of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to examine cryptocurrency data. The following steps were taken

Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.

Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.

Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.

Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.

Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
